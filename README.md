# Data Analytics on Uber Data On GCP - Data Engineering Project
The objective of this project is to perform data analytics on Uber data on GCP using different tools and technologies such as gcp Cloud Storage, Big Query, Mage, Looker Studio.

## Tools and Technology used:
- Programming language: Python
- GCP Cloud Storage
- Big Query
- ETL Tool: Mage
- Google Looker Studio

## Dataset:
Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). The trip data was not created by the TLC, and TLC makes no representations as to the accuracy of these data.
